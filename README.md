# rock-paper-scissors  

A game I made as part of a personal challenge (inspired by the 100 days of code) to code everyday.  
It was made with the basic knowledge of javascript I currently possess and though it took me shorter than I expected, I know the code definitely is very bulky.  

As I code on and learn simpler ways to do things, I might simplify the code behind this one (if I have the drive to).  
If anyone is reading this, contributions and suggestions also make me very glad.
